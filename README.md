# string_calculator

-Implement following requirements
- StringCalculator should be able to accept any number of parts. E.g. ‘3,4,5,54,6’
- StringCalculator should be able to accept any non-number delimiter. E.g. ‘3 4 5’ or ‘3%4%5’
- StringCalculator should be able to accept a delimiter of any length . E.g. ‘3 delim 4 delim 5 delim 6 delim 7’
- add() function should be able to accept a delimiter, which is not the same across the string. You already know the example: "3*&^4******7%$#90"
- add() function should be able to accept a range of numbers provided as range start and range end, with double dot in between. Example: "3,4..6,7,10,33..56,1"
In this example 4..6 should be extrapolated to 4,5,6
- Every test added should be a separate commit in git
